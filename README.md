# WebNote
## About
WebNote is a way to make notes with katex and will auto populate notes and homework. This is all built poorly with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. It also uses [katex](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX). This is not a safe program. :/
## How to use.
The php page, notes.php is where you can write your notes. Most importantly is where you save your file. You need to save it in a folder for your class. You will see that I have classes, lambda, logic, formal_language, etc. So when I save I will put the location as lambda/n/ 
So you would type:
myclassfoldername/n/
This is not safe by any means. If someone gets your website addy and is not nice they can just post a lot lol.... :/
## Organization
Make a folder that you will remember for you class. For example, are you taking Calculus III? make a folder called calculusIII Then inside that folder make folders called hw and n These are for homework and notes. 
## Notes
Notes are saved in the class folder name and then under a folder named n 
## Homework
Homework needs to be saved in the class folder name and then under a folder named hw
